## 🌿 Mental Health / Fitness App — UI/UX Design

### 🔹 Task Overview  
This project involved designing a **mobile app** focused on improving mental or physical well-being.  
The goal was to create an interface that feels calm, supportive, and motivating while helping users build healthy habits.

I chose to design a **wellness app** that supports users in tracking habits, staying consistent, and monitoring their mental/physical progress.

This project includes:

- 📱 **High-Fidelity Screens** of the core user journey  
- 📄 **Case Study** explaining the research, flow, and design process
